Coarse model
1. Try training with GAN
2. Try change the predicted range from [0, 1] to [-1, 1] via tanh function


Refiner model
1. Try resample 3d points at every iteration
2. Try 2 backbone tails instead of 1 which further concatenate or summ their features
3. Try spatial attention module for feature maps with bigger resolution (attention maps should be orthogonal)
4. Separate the processing of real and rendered images into 2 branches with further concatenation
