Coarse model
1. Try training with GAN
2. Try change the predicted range from [0, 1] to [-1, 1] via tanh function
3. Try differentiable way of 3d-2d matching (not classic RANSAC PNP)
4. Increase the mapping range (-127, 127) -> (-500, 500)
Refiner model
1. Try resample 3d points at every iteration: No significant changes. Training and validation performance is slightly worse, but it hopefully prevents overfitting
2. Try spatial attention module for feature maps with bigger resolution (attention maps should be orthogonal)
3. Separate the processing of real and rendered images into 2 branches with further concatenation
4. Try another parametrization of predicted translation
